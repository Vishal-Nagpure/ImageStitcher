# ImageStitcher

The goal of the project is to explore how to "stitch together" 2 stacks
of images capturing nerve cell structure in different regions of a
brain. 

## Minimum requirements:
1. Linux is supported as a development and production platform
2. Java 7 or above. You can download latest Oracle JDK from -
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html
3. Apache Hadoop 2.7.3
4. Apache Maven 3.3.9 or above
5. Git client

## Installation on Linux environment (Local)
Following are the steps to setup and build the project on Ubuntu Linux environment using CLI. 
Please make sure that commands - `git, mvn, hadoop and java` can be executed directly from the command line. 
If not, please add them to the PATH environment variable.

1. Check out the project using - `git clone https://github.com/ankur-shanbhag/ImageStitcher.git`
2. Steps to build the project
  * `cp configuration.properties.template configuration.properties`
  * Open _configuration.properties_ and add values for all the properties as per instructions in the file.   
    Eg: __hadoop.home=/usr/local/hadoop-2.7.3/__  
    The properties related to GnuPlot are optional and only needed by developers for debugging (discussed below)
  * Build the project - `./image-stitcher.sh build`
3. Create an input directory with files containing configuration parameters required by clustering algorithm.
4. Run the project using - `./image-stitcher.sh [input directory path] [output directory path to be created]`

**NOTE:** If any of the steps does not work, verify all the required softwares are installed with specified versions. 

## Installation on AWS EMR
1. Start EMR cluster with Hadoop 2.7 or above.
2. SSH to AWS master node. For steps follow http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-connect-master-node-ssh.html
3. Install Git on master using `sudo yum install git-all`
4. Install Apache Maven using following commands
   * `sudo wget http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo`
   * `sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo`
   * `sudo yum install -y apache-maven`
5. Copy input files, source and target image files EMR master using `scp`  
   Eg: `scp -i [keyFile].pem -r ~/input hadoop@[emr-master-dns]:/home/hadoop`
7. Create S3 bucket (recommended for working on EMR) or use HDFS as distributed storage. To use HDFS refer - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22343918/how-do-i-use-hdfs-with-emr
6. Once you have copied all the required file and have `git` and `mvn` installed, the steps to checkout and build the project is same as local environment.  

**NOTE:** By default, Hadoop on EMR machines is installed at location `/usr/lib/hadoop`. Also, currently we do not support GnuPlot on EMR.

## GnuPlot for debugging
Optionally, developers can debug the output generated by the program by plotting 3D scatter plot on their local machines. However, we do not support GnuPlot feature on EMR instances. For users working with EMR, copy the output files using `scp` to their local enironment.  
Following are the instructions to use GnuPlot on local machine:

1. Install GnuPlot -
   * For Debian based distributions (like Ubuntu) use - `sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11`
   * For RHEL, Fedora, CentOS do following -
     * `sudo yum update` 
     * `sudo yum install gnuplot`
     * Note: For some reason if below intructions doesn't work, execute command `gnuplot` to enter gnuplot shell and change the terminal to `x11` using command `set terminal x11`
2. Before you can use gnuplot, you must generate output using - `./image-stitcher.sh run inputDir outputDir` command
3. The output directory will may have multiple part files generated by the mapreduce program (depending on number of lines in the input file). Each part file contains a list of matching correspondences (from source to target) generated based on the one line of input configuration parameters. To visualize these points on a 3D scatter plot, execute following command:  `./image-stitcher.sh plot [path to a part file inside generated outputDir]`
